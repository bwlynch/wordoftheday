## Word of the Day

### Overview

The word of the day app is intended to be a simple application for teaching vocabulary. As of now, running `python3 wordoftheday.py` will choose one word ten or more characters long and give you the part of speech and definition of that word. The long-term plan is to modify the script so that it sends out the words over email or SMS, and add features such as a summary at the end of the week of all of the past week's words and/or some type of quiz feature to quiz users on the words they've been learning.
